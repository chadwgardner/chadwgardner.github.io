            No matter what I write, I tend to wax reflective, either by extrapolating the theme out to the world at large, or by turning inward, so perhaps the category of Reflection is simply too broad. But until I change my mind, here are all the posts I've tagged as such.

            <p>Like many of you, I'm feeling a mix of emotions right now: a strange cocktail of shock but also of familiarity, of energy but also resignation, the kneejerk desire to blame every racist-homophobic-gun-loving redneck who voted for him but also the desire for the Left to take a hard look at itself.</p>
              <p>Harris did not lose the election for any one strategic decision, or policy, or position. She was placed in a near-impossible situation, and she and her team did just about the damned best job they could have.

            <p>I've recently picked up fishing more seriously. I've always loved it, and I've had a simple kayak here in Jacksonville for a number of years, but I never had anything fancy or any gear that made fishing from a kayak particularly simple or easy. In April, after I got vaccinated, I started playing in-person poker again, and I was doing fairly well! But then delta hit, and I decided to back out again for a bit. So I spent my poker bankroll on an actual, pedal-driven fishing kayak...

            <p>Now I've worked more from home for my new job than at the office. It's been a full year since I've seen my family back in Austin. My wife and I became home owners for the first time, moving out of a house we shared with our close friends for the last four years, with all of the feelings that entails. We pulled our kids out of public school, tried to go back, then pulled them out again. And one close friend and my mother-in-law are both fighting off the tail-end of COVID this Christmas morning...

            <p>I didn't sleep well the other night. I saw each hour of the night displayed on the alarm clock. Maybe I stole some little slices of rest, but mostly I just failed at clearing my mind over and over again. School was starting the next morning, and, while I wasn't actively dreading it, perhaps by brain is just tired of it, unwilling to jump into the new semester. I teach good kids, and my coworkers and administration are great, but I just feel so bored, so unfulfilled. I haven't figured out what's so different this year than previous ones. I was a little bored then too, but not to this extent...

                I've been absent from the blogosphere this summer. It seems to be something of a perpetual truth in my life that when I finally have time to write, I do something else.

                The school year has just begun with me not knowing quite where the summer went. In July we traveled, &nbsp;and I had training, but I have no clue where June went. I don't feel like I've been teaching for a year already. That was it? One and counting? I'll be getting to five and then ten by next week it seems. A year feels like too small an increment...

                Several months ago, I asked my students to reflect on the following quote:

                Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living.

                Eleven years ago, a good friend of mine died in a car accident on the way to school. He swerved to miss a deer and flipped his Ford Explorer. We were juniors in high school at the time and in the band together. Along with some friends, we would carpool to the early-morning marching practices. I think it was during chemistry that an administrator came over the announcements and asked all the band members to come to the band hall. By this time there were rumors, but nobody knew what was going on. While the rest of the school heard the news, our band director told us that Josh had died that morning...

                Here is a little example of how far behind our children are. I gave a test about the conservation of momentum several weeks ago. It was, as they all are, a multiple choice test. I have Casio scientific calculators in my room for the students to use, and when they plugged in their numbers into the momentum equation (p=mv), the calculator told them the answer was ".1". Now, the answers on the actual test ranged from, "10.0", "1.0", "0.10", and "0.01". I had <i>several </i>students raise their hand to ask why their answer wasn't one of the choices, as they were pretty sure they had done it correctly...

                The other night I had the pleasure of attending a small dinner and concert at a little bed and breakfast in Dripping Springs. The original house was built in 1857, and the evening began with a brief history of the original owners and how it came to be what it is today. Overall the evening was beautiful. It was small; no more than twenty-five people, with the dining room doubling as the concert space...

                On the drive to the high school where I teach, there is a hill which always manages to offer me a splendid view of the morning. This past Monday when I topped the hill, due to the clouds (and probably pollution), the sun was enormous as it peaked over the horizon. It reminded me of something from The Lion King: wavy and red as a smoldering coal. I smiled to myself as I imagined the entire hemisphere spinning toward the sun...

                On Wednesday, my wife and I, along with many family and friends, welcomed our firstborn son into the world. Ira was born at 10:26 AM, weighing in at 8 lbs 3 oz. Both Agata and Ira are in great health, and labor went easily as far as labors go (well, you might have to verify that with her...). We named him Ira for a couple of reasons. My Puerto Rican maternal great-grandmother was named Iris, and we toyed with naming a daughter that before we knew he was a boy. Also, I think we just listen to too much NPR. Ira Glass and Ira Flatow now have a namesake...

                Every now and then, more so these days, I need a little reminder that life isn't quite so serious as it's made out to be. Cosmic forces do not hang in the balance. There aren't answers to the all-consuming questions of life. And sometimes, there really isn't anything else I should be doing. I have yet to find a better way to jostle a melancholy mood than Billy Collins. The former Poet Laureate has mastered the art of embarrassing his readers back to a state of sober levity...

                I started graduate school with big plans. I was going to write <i>the book</i>, the book that would make everyone say, "OH!  How did I not see this? Finally!" and boom, the world would be saved. I knew deep down that it wasn't actually going to be like that, but I wasn't prepared for exactly how much it's <i>nothing like that at all</i>. Higher education, especially the humanities, has become a pyramid scheme: cheap graduate student and adjunct professor labor holds up grossly inflated university president salaries. Tenure track positions are being replaced with five adjunct positions...
