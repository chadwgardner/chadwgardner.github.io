            Much like my Reflections tag, this one is probably too broad. I hardly write anything that doesn't provide some sort of social or political commentary. Some parts are more explicit about this though. Like the rest of these historical posts, each of these had a context, and my views have evolved in many ways over the years, but I preserve the originals below.

            <p>Like many of you, I'm feeling a mix of emotions right now: a strange cocktail of shock but also of familiarity, of energy but also resignation, the kneejerk desire to blame every racist-homophobic-gun-loving redneck who voted for him but also the desire for the Left to take a hard look at itself.</p>
              <p>Harris did not lose the election for any one strategic decision, or policy, or position. She was placed in a near-impossible situation, and she and her team did just about the damned best job they could have. Given the hand she was dealt, maybe we were foolish to hope for any other outcome. But maybe not...

We pulled our kids out of public school, tried to go back, then pulled them out again. And one close friend and my mother-in-law are both fighting off the tail-end of COVID this Christmas morning...

                  One of the years I was studying at Florida State, I taught a History and Philosophy of Science class based around film. Each week we would discuss how a certain film portrays science and its relationship to the rest of human life. This course was one of the more rewarding courses I've taught, and one film stands out as the most thought provoking and revealing: <i><a href=" https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080594/" target="_blank">The Day After Trinity</a></i>. Released in 1981, <i>The Day After Trinity</i>, explores the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb...

                  It seems so strange: how did we forgot how to talk to one another? How did we lose our sense of community, of belonging, of neighborly care? When did we start generalizing, bifurcating, and stereotyping to such a degree that only two, infinitely pliable and immensely dangerous categories remain: <i>us </i>and <i>them</i>? We now speak in nothing but glittering generalities, afraid to say or hear hard lessons built on hard evidence: "there is no insult like the truth."

                At FSU, my professor proposed this question: what if you were invited to a dinner party and brought a relatively nice bottle of wine, something in the $25 dollar rangeâ€”not too pricey but not too cheap. Then, a few weeks later, when you in turn have the couple over for dinner to your place, they bring the same bottle of wine. Why does that strike us as odd? A gift for a gift right? Or what if they bring a bottle which costs $70 instead? Or $4.99? If your return gift is too expensive, then it can be perceived as showing off or as communicating some kind dissatisfaction with the received gift...

                Here is a little example of how far behind our children are. I gave a test about the conservation of momentum several weeks ago. It was, as they all are, a multiple choice test. I have Casio scientific calculators in my room for the students to use, and when they plugged in their numbers into the momentum equation (p=mv), the calculator told them the answer was ".1". Now, the answers on the actual test ranged from, "10.0", "1.0", "0.10", and "0.01". I had <i>several </i>students raise their hand to ask why their answer wasn't one of the choices, as they were pretty sure they had done it correctly...

                On the drive to the high school where I teach, there is a hill which always manages to offer me a splendid view of the morning. This past Monday when I topped the hill, due to the clouds (and probably pollution), the sun was enormous as it peaked over the horizon. It reminded me of something from The Lion King: wavy and red as a smoldering coal. I smiled to myself as I imagined the entire hemisphere spinning toward the sun...

                I finally managed to get some reading done over the Thanksgiving break. A good friend of mine lent me Richard Rorty's <i>Achieving our Country: Leftist Thought in Twentieth Century America</i>, and it turned out to be one of the most interesting and rewarding books I've read in awhile. It's a serious of lectures delivered in 1998, and it's less than a hundred pages. But A little background is necessary to appreciate some of the details.

                A lot of different people mean a lot of different things when they use the word "postmodern." When I use it, I tend to mean something like what Nietzsche meant by "God is dead." That is, objective Truth, perfection,  utopia, or the realization of an ideal are no longer our goals in science or society. It means that there is not one answer to life's questions, not one ring to rule them all, not one all-knowing perspective, no "knowledge without a knower." Thinking along these lines has pervaded most of the liberal arts since the 1970s...

                In <i>Finding Neverland</i> (2004), there's great little scene where Johnny Depp's character, P.M. Barrie, the author of Peter Pan, is performing for some children in a park. He pretends to be a fearless bear trainer, and his furry friend, Porthos, plays the part of the bear. But before he begins, Peter, the young realist, played by Freddie Highmore, says "But this is absurd...

                I am no literary critic, but I see the difference between a utopia and a dystopia as this: a dystopia generally takes a particular feature of the actual world which the author finds ominous and extrapolates it into the future, predicting just what society might look like should that feature be allowed to continue its present course. <i>Fahrenheit 451 </i>is about censorship and the freedom of ideas, the film <i>Equilibrium</i> is about the desire to rid humanity of the emotional (and therefore the uncontrollable) side of human nature, and <i>1984</i> was about the dangers of totalitarianism...

                I've been thinking about freedom a lot these days, mostly due to a strange constellation of recent events. First, this semester I'm sitting in on an undergraduate course called "Religion, Self, and Society," where we read John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and John Stuart Mill. The course ends with a look at the Supreme Court and its involvement with the Mormons over plural marriage...
