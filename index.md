am therefore sort of cheating using this Markdown to webiste via Jekyll via Github thing, and
I still don't really know what I'm doing).

Here's a cute picture of my wife that also includes me.

[Here's a link](posts/tattoo.md) to the my post about the tattoo I'm designing. I had this on Medium,
but that seemed silly.

Some [Christmas 2020 reflections](posts/christmas.md).
