          The adults sit and listen. <br>
          Guitars on the small stage sing the tight harmonies of old<br>
          practiced gospels. <br>
          Their voices bear the scratch marks from last night's smoke-filled halls<br>
          but still seep out with the soft ease of mastery. <br>
          <br>
          We pass the tip jar down the aisle like on the Sunday mornings<br>
          of our youth, also practiced,<br>
          collecting money for the area food bank...

            One of the years I was studying at Florida State, I taught a History and Philosophy of Science class based around film. Each week we would discuss how a certain film portrays science and its relationship to the rest of human life. This course was one of the more rewarding courses I've taught, and one film stands out as the most thought provoking and revealing: <i><a href=" https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080594/" target="_blank">The Day After Trinity</a></i>. Released in 1981, <i>The Day After Trinity</i>, explores the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb...

          <p>I didn't sleep well the other night. I saw each hour of the night displayed on the alarm clock. Maybe I stole some little slices of rest, but mostly I just failed at clearing my mind over and over again. School was starting the next morning, and, while I wasn't actively dreading it, perhaps by brain is just tired of it, unwilling to jump into the new semester. I teach good kids, and my coworkers and administration are great, but I just feel so bored, so unfulfilled. I haven't figured out what's so different this year than previous ones. I was a little bored then too, but not to this extent...

          <p>So it's finally over! I can come out of the Kaggle hole in which I've been hiding for the last month or so. It's been quite a little ride.&nbsp;<a href="https://chadwgardner.com/2018/04/04/my-first-kaggle-contest-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When we left off</a>, I was struggling to engineer some new features and&nbsp; was looking at ways to deal with the size of the data set, such as using an Easy Ensemble (which failed miserably). Since then, I had several little breakthroughs.</p>

          <p>First, I started using a much better validation method...

          <p>I'm still not in a place to really produce some original, quality analysis of my own yet, so I thought I'd teach you all about what is probably the most common pitfall in data science: over-fitting.</p>

          <p>
            In very broad strokes, machine learning consists of splitting your data set into two chunks: a training set and a test set. Then you take whatever model you are attempting to use, whether it's linear regression, k-nearest-neighbors, or a random forest, etc., and "train" it on the training set. This involves tuning the hyperparameters that minimize whichever error function you're using...

          <p>The&nbsp;<em>best</em> way to read this report is on my Github page&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/chadwgardner/kaggle_survey/blob/master/kaggle.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

          <p>I realized last night that I have yet to really articulate why I am making this switch from teaching to data science. There's more to it than just not being fully satisfied with teaching and needing a job to earn a buck. This post is more for me than it is you, but I thought I'd share.</p>

          <p>Those of you who know me well know that I spent last fall studying for the LSAT. I was fairly convinced for about a year and a half that I wanted to become a lawyer. I was taken with the idea of using my mind to answer tough questions and to convince others of my argument's merit, all while fighting for the most vulnerable...
