          I have been working to archive all of my old posts here. Over the years I maintained several different blogs with different purposes and for different audiences, and my views on many things have evolved over the years. Enjoy these, but know that each has its context, and most would need a significant number of footnotes to being them up-to-date.

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>I'm still not in a place to really produce some original, quality analysis of my own yet, so I thought I'd teach you all about what is probably the most common pitfall in data science: over-fitting.</p>

          <p>
            In very broad strokes, machine learning consists of splitting your data set into two chunks: a training set and a test set. Then you take whatever model you are attempting to use, whether it's linear regression, k-nearest-neighbors, or a random forest, etc., and "train" it on the training set. This involves tuning the hyperparameters that minimize whichever error function you're using...

            One of the years I was studying at Florida State, I taught a History and Philosophy of Science class based around film. Each week we would discuss how a certain film portrays science and its relationship to the rest of human life. This course was one of the more rewarding courses I've taught, and one film stands out as the most thought provoking and revealing: <i><a href=" https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080594/" target="_blank">The Day After Trinity</a></i>. Released in 1981, <i>The Day After Trinity</i>, explores the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb...

            It seems so strange: how did we forgot how to talk to one another? How did we lose our sense of community, of belonging, of neighborly care? When did we start generalizing, bifurcating, and stereotyping to such a degree that only two, infinitely pliable and immensely dangerous categories remain: <i>us </i>and <i>them</i>? We now speak in nothing but glittering generalities, afraid to say or hear hard lessons built on hard evidence: "there is no insult like the truth."
