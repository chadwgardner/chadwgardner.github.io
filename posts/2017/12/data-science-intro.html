<p>Hello world! My name is Chad Gardner. I am former AP Physics teacher, with an educational background in astronomy, philosophy, and religion(?!). I am currently a stay-at-home dad, spending what spare time I can muster learning Python for data science. I hope to use this site as a place to dump my brain, share my progress, keep myself accountable, and all those other reason people start blogs. Eventually, this will morph into a portfolio filled with beautiful insights, graphs, and stories from the world of data. I have another, <a href="http://cwgardner.blogspot.com/">somewhat neglected blog</a>, where I post the odd poem, philosophical insight, or political rant. Here, I hope to stick to data science, Python, and the questions that can be answered with them. I hope to be employed in this new field within a year or so, ideally without having to go back to school. Enjoy the ride!</p>
<p>-Chad</p>
