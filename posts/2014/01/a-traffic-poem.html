    Those of you who know me or who have been following this blog probably know that <a href="https://cwgardner.blogspot.com/2013/10/poetry-and-past.html" target="_blank">I thoroughly enjoy the poetry of Billy Collins.</a>&nbsp; Agata and I were lucky enough to get to hear him read and speak at the Paramount last week here in Austin. I used to write a lot of poetry when I was younger; I even took a year of creative writing classes in undergrad, but none of it was ever very good. I recently decided to try my hand again.

    slid away this morning like an electric window<br />
    whirring into hidden slots. <br />

    stranded strangers warmed by coffee and a sense of humor. <br />

    But this January morning nobody moved at all. <br />

    World Peace, a recipe:<br />
    freezing temperatures<br />
    a delayed sand truck<br />
    bridges. <br />
    Garnish with a light rain.
