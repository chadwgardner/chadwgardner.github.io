          Those of you who know me or who have been following this blog probably know that <a href="/posts/2013/10/poetry-and-the-past.html" target="_blank">I thoroughly enjoy the poetry of Billy Collins.</a> Agata and I were lucky enough to get to hear him read and speak at the Paramount last week here in Austin. I used to write a lot of poetry when I was younger; I even took a year of creative writing classes in undergrad, but none of it was ever very good. I recently decided to try my hand again. So, inspired by Collins, here is my first. I was piqued by a certain traffic problem I encountered on the way to school this past Tuesday, when my school district failed to delay the start of school...

          "A Recipe"<br>
          by Chad Gardner<br>
          <br>
          The anonymity provided by the veil of windshields<br>
          slid away this morning like an electric window<br>
          whirring into hidden slots.<br>
          <br>
          The bridge is closed, I said.<br>
          As he looked back over his shoulder I smiled and added,<br>
          That one is too.<br>
          <br>
          There must have been a hundred of us<br>
          stranded strangers warmed by coffee and a sense of humor.<br>
          Yesterday we sped and weaved and cursed,<br>
          empathy filtered out by our polarized glass.<br>
          But this January morning nobody moved at all.<br>
          <br>
          World Peace, a recipe:<br>
          freezing temperatures<br>
          a delayed sand truck<br>
          bridges.<br>
          Garnish with a light rain.<br>
