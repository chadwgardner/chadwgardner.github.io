          <p>"Why?" by Chad Gardner<br>
          Inspired by a passage from <i>Flight Behavior</i> by Barbara Kingsolver</p>
          <br>
          Because we are beings who live in a world where one thing follows another. <br />
          Because correlation does not imply causation. <br />
          Because we don't know everything. <br />
          Because this is the only earth. <br />
          Because community gardens might be the only thing left that can save the world. <br />
          Because I need my neighbors. <br />
          Because my neighbors need me. <br />
          <br />
          Because difference should be cherished. <br />
          Because every child deserves the chance to think for her or himself. <br />
          Because we are all part of the problem. <br />
          Because we grow from the wombs of mothers. <br />
          Because our zip codes are too predictive. <br />
          Because you are not self-made. <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Because the stars were bright where I grew up. <br />
          Because I was taught to value that. <br />
          Because my teachers had high expectations of me. <br />
          Because everyone was there for me. <br />
          Because I am not self made either. <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Because I must live this way. <br />
          Because I must leave it better than I found it. <br />
          Because soil, water, sunlight, and seeds produce life. <br />
          Because the taste of sun-warmed strawberries. <br />
          Because trees should be filled with birds. <br />
          Because homemade. <br />
          Because front porches. <br />
          Because my children. <br />
          Because theirs. <br />
