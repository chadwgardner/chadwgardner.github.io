Why?<br />
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Inspired from a passage in&nbsp;</i>Flight Behavior<i>&nbsp;by Barbara Kingsolver</i></span><br />
<br />
Because we are beings who live in a world where one thing follows another.<br />
Because correlation does not imply causation.<br />
Because we don't know everything.<br />
Because this is the only earth.<br />
Because community gardens might be the only thing left that can save the world.<br />
Because I need my neighbors.<br />
Because my neighbors need me.<br />
<br />
Because difference should be cherished.<br />
Because every child deserves the chance to think for her or himself.<br />
Because we are all part of the problem.<br />
Because we grow from the wombs of mothers.<br />
Because our zip codes are too predictive.<br />
Because you are not self-made.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because the stars were bright where I grew up.<br />
Because I was taught to value that.<br />
Because my teachers had high expectations of me.<br />

Because everyone was there for me.<br />
Because &nbsp;I am not self made either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because I must live this way.<br />
Because I must leave it better than I found it.<br />
Because soil, water, sunlight, and seeds produce life.<br />
Because the taste of sun-warmed strawberries.<br />
Because trees should be filled with birds.<br />
Because homemade.<br />
Because front porches.<br />
Because my children.<br />
Because theirs.<br />
