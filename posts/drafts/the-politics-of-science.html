I have written in the past about the <a href="https://cwgardner.blogspot.com/2014/05/the-limits-of-knowledge.html" target="_blank">limits of scientific knowledge</a>&nbsp;and about the distinction between science and religion (<a href="https://cwgardner.blogspot.com/2013/03/religion-vs-science-still.html">here</a> and <a href="https://cwgardner.blogspot.com/2013/05/human-dignity-and-worry-of-reductionism.html">here</a>). If you want a more complete explanation of my views, I encourage you to read those posts first, but I will give a brief recap here.<br />
<br />
Science is not in the business of discovering Truth—with a capital T. Rather, science is the model-building business. It constructs concepts which are used to tie together observations. Then it creates more concepts to tie together those concepts, and on and on until you have a grand unified theory of everything. Maybe a quick example will elucidate what I'm talking about. The electron is a figment of our imagination. It's an idea we've constructed to explain certain observations, such as the interaction between a balloon rubbed on wool and your hair. Electron is a metaphor. So is the heliocentric model of our solar system.<br />
<br />
The concept of the "electron", at a fundamental level, is just like the concept of "chair". It's a tool we use to cut reality into identifiable chunks. We can then use those chunks to communicate about, analyze, or predict aspects of the world. A chair is raised, flat surface with back designed for us to sit in. The difference between "chair" and "electron" is one of degree, not of kind. "Electron" has much more rigor involved in its definition. There are grey areas of "chair"—e.g. does a beanbag belong is the "chair" category? "Electron" is less ambiguous: it's the piece of the universe which matches certain measurements we can make of it (charge, mass, etc.).<br />
<br />
But what happens when two models conflict with one another? What if my model says the earth is 4.6 billions years old and yours says it's only 6,000? The key is that each of these models was built for different reasons, reasons based on different values. Those that hold to the former model tend to value correspondence between their model and observations of the world. Those that hold to the latter value correspondence between their model and a literal reading of the book of Genesis. Neither model is more True than the other. The question of the age of the earth <i>has no right answer</i>:&nbsp;there is no ultimate standard of Truth by which we can judge one model against another. Ultimately, we end up comparing values and baseline assumptions: is it important or not for our models to be naturalistic, should they correspond to scientific observations or to the Word of God? No outside criteria can help us decide between models because the decision is really one about deciding between values, and any criteria must themselves be based on those values. And how could we decide between values without being self-referential? Why is it important for the models scientists build to correspond to data? Well that's just what science <i>is</i>. Why is it important for certain Christians to read Genesis literally? Because that's what their version of Christianity <i>is</i>.<br />
<br />
Now to politics. If the above conception of how knowledge and science work is accurate, it means that the authority that science has is not based in some concept of the Truth or the Real World out there somewhere. Scientists and their models are not more Right than anyone else about the nature of reality. Scientists do no have special access to reality. Rather, since two of the core values that scientists hold and on which their models are built are predictability and correspondence to observations, if you're interested in the way the world works and what will likely happen in the future, then scientific models are the models for you. Our scientific models of the universe are being tested constantly: with every new piece of technology we invent, every new building we build, and every experiment we run, our scientific models demonstrate that they accurately describe the way the the world works.<br />
<br />
You might be tempted to make the leap from "science describes the way to the world works" to "science works because it's True," but we can't make this leap. In the end, even something as concrete&nbsp;as an electron—that subatomic particle that jumps from atom to atom, powering our entire existence—is just a figment of our well honed imagination. This is not to say that world doesn't exist or that we should all be solipsistic. Rather, this is just a firm limit on the role and ability of science.<br />
<br />
I want to be clear about something. Just because science isn't after the Truth, doesn't mean that the knowledge it produces can be safely ignored. Science is the most powerful and reliable form of practical knowledge that we have. If you are interested in building things or predicting the future, science is the best tool you have. All of the great scientific and technological accomplishments have been achieved with naturalistic models of how the world works, not with knowledge of the ultimate nature of reality. The point of my explanation above is not to belittle science or dismiss its conclusions: rather, it is to make clear how science works so as to pinpoint the authority it should have in our society and the grounds on which that authority is based.<br />
