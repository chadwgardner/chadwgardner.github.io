I've been lucky in most of my endeavors: most things I've tried in my life never came too hard. From music to physics to philosophy, I've never really felt out of my element...until now.<br />
<br />
I've just finished my third week at an alternative school in Jacksonville which is designed for middle school students who are a year or two behind. We try to get them through two school years in one, hoping to catch them back up to their peers so they can enter high school on level. It's hard to put my finger on exactly why I feel so down right now. I'm overwhelmed by a combination of lack of sleep (we are sleep training Cedine right now, and I have to wake up at five in the morning for work), learning the new systems of the school district, the adjustment to middle-schoolers and to 90-minute periods (we're on block schedule), the expectation to track and document every single encounter and accommodation, and by having to be the "mean" teacher when my style is more goofy, self-deprecating, and excited about science.<br />
<br />
I took this job to get me out of my comfort zone, to keep me learning something new. I had taught AP Physics for two years in Texas before the recent move to Jacksonville.<br />
<br />
I don't want to have to be one of the "mean" teachers in order to do my job. I understand that many of these kids need structure because their life at home is chronically chaotic, and I understand that such structure needs to come from firm and consistent follow through, but I don't have those skills yet. I'm used to teaching high school students, who, despite their faults, can still be mostly be reasoned with.<br />
<br />
With middle school students it's a whole different ball game. I don't know what to do with kids who get emotionally traumatized when the wrong student looks at them a certain way. I had pull one of my students into the hall on Wednesday. She was so mad she could barely speak. The reason? "She put my name in her mouth."<br />
