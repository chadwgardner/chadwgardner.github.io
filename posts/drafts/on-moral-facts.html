Recently, I came across <a href="https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/why-our-children-dont-think-there-are-moral-facts/?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=c-column-top-span-region&amp;region=c-column-top-span-region&amp;WT.nav=c-column-top-span-region" target="_blank">this</a>&nbsp;article in the NY Times, where a&nbsp;Justin McBrayer, a philosopher at&nbsp;Fort Lewis College,&nbsp;laments our children's lack of&nbsp;knowledge of moral facts. &nbsp;McBrayer is concerned that our children are being taught a naive dichotomy between facts and opinions. When he went to visit his son's second-grade classroom, he saw a sign over the bulletin board which read:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4375rem; margin-bottom: 1em; max-width: 540px;">
<em>Fact: Something that is true about a subject and can be tested or proven.&nbsp;</em><em>Opinion: What someone thinks, feels, or believes.</em></div>
He criticizes this distinction because fact<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">First, the definition of a fact waffles between truth and proof — two obviously different features. Things can be true even if no one can prove them. For example, it could be true that there is life elsewhere in the universe even though no one can prove it. Conversely, many of the things we once “proved” turned out to be false</span></div>
But worse, he says, is that students are taught that a claim is either a fact or an opinion, and never both. He has this conversation with his son:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4375rem; margin-bottom: 1em; max-width: 540px;">
Me: “I believe that George Washington was the first president. Is that a fact or an opinion?”<br />
Him: “It’s a fact.”<br />
Me: “But I believe it, and you said that what someone believes is an opinion.”<br />
Him: “Yeah, but it’s true.”<br />
Me: “So it’s both a fact&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;an opinion?”<br />
The blank stare on his face said it all.</div>
The gist of his position is contained in these two paragraphs: <br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="margin-bottom: 1em; max-width: 540px;">
In <span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4375rem;">summary, our public schools teach students that all claims are either facts or opinions and that all value and moral claims fall into the latter camp. The punchline: there are no moral facts. And if there are no moral facts, then there are no moral truths...</span></div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;">We can do better. Our children deserve a consistent intellectual foundation. Facts are things that are true. Opinions are things we believe. Some of our beliefs are true. Others are not. Some of our beliefs are backed by evidence. Others are not. Value claims are like any other claims: either true or false, evidenced or not. The hard work lies not in recognizing that at least some moral claims are true but in carefully thinking through our evidence for which of the many competing moral claims is correct. That’s a hard thing to do. But we can’t sidestep the responsibilities that come with being human just because it’s hard. That would be wrong.</span></div>
<br />
<br />
Now, there is some good critique here about the wishy-washy nature of the fact/opinion divide, and I agree with him that value claims are just like any other claim, evidenced or not. <br />
