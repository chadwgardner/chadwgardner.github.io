"The Purgatory Players" by Chad Gardner<br />
<br />
The adults sit and listen.<br />
Guitars on the small stage sing the tight harmonies of old<br />
practiced gospels.<br />
Their voices bear the scratch marks from last night's smoke-filled halls<br />
but still seep out with the soft ease of mastery.<br />
<br />
We pass the tip jar down the aisle like on the Sunday mornings<br />
of our youth, also practiced,<br />
collecting money for the area food bank.<br />
<br />
On the floor sits my son,<br />
oblivious and yet more attuned than any of us,<br />
drawing circles on the headlines:<br />
another sentencing<br />
another attempt at diplomacy<br />
another attack<br />
another failure<br />
now covered by the wheels of a car<br />
or maybe the endless path of a ceiling fan blade,<br />
a cloud of bubbles or colored plastic balls.<br />
<br />
The innocence of his youth rests like a garnish on the simple hopes<br />
rising in those chords and crinkled bills,<br />
the hope that we still have a reason to do good work,<br />
that a difference might be made.<br />
<br />
Sunday morning in an Austin coffee shop<br />
caught between the ache to do more<br />
the need to sit and listen<br />
and the quiet doodling of a two-year-old.<br />
<br />
