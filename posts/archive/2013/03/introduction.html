When I was an undergrad, I started writing my first
novel.&nbsp; I made it about five hundred
words in before I realized I knew absolutely nothing about writing any such
thing.&nbsp; My ideas&nbsp;weren't&nbsp;creative
ones—they&nbsp;weren't&nbsp;<i>people</i>.&nbsp; Rather, they were as non-fiction as it
gets.&nbsp; In <i>The End of the Affair</i>, Graham Greene semi-autobiographically
recalls a time when one of his characters just&nbsp;wouldn't&nbsp;come alive for
him.&nbsp; Greene&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;get into his head
and figure out what the protagonist would say to his lover or how he would
react to the circumstances thrust before him.&nbsp;
I realized after reading this that I did not have what it takes to create
another human being, and my characters forever remained scratches on paper.<br />

and it was going to follow a Dead Poets, Inkling-like group through their
formative years in college.&nbsp; They were
the Fulcrums.&nbsp; As you might have guessed,
I was attempting to be clever and draw from Archimedes famous little quip about
levers: “Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the earth.”&nbsp; It was a bit <i>too</i> clever.<o:p></o:p><br />

Now, after teaching high school for a year, receiving a MA
and stumbling through half of a PhD program so far, I realize moving the world
is a bit more complicated than all that.&nbsp;
Structures don’t budge easily; traditions think they never change at all;
revolutions tend to change things too quickly, replacing one tyrannical power with
another. History has gained momentum, and we are formed by our past more than
we shape our future.&nbsp; Society has grown
too large, too complicated.&nbsp; It has too
many buttons and levers, and the consequences for pushing the wrong one have
become drastic.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></div>

I have come to realize that I am no Archimedes: I am not an
earth mover.&nbsp; The words I write will not
save the world, and people will continue in their ways until, for whatever
reason, they no longer can.&nbsp; So where
does that leave me?&nbsp; What is my role on
this planet, in this society, or country, or city, or neighborhood?&nbsp; Perhaps it’s not to work the lever, but to
help build the fulcrum.&nbsp; My trade will
always be in words, in teaching and learning, in reading and writing.&nbsp; So, to explore this possibility, to think out
loud, to vent, to share, to learn, I’ll be writing here.<o:p></o:p></div>

I am interested in intelligent conversation, pragmatic
thinking, and mutual respect.&nbsp; There are already
too many sound bites, too many Facebook rants, too many talking points and
slogans.&nbsp; I look forward to musing here,
and I look forward to your comments.<o:p></o:p></div>
