To the reader,

The&nbsp;<em>best</em> way to read this report is on my Github page&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/chadwgardner/kaggle_survey/blob/master/kaggle.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. You can also play around with the code yourself by forking (copying) the kernel on Kaggle itself <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/chadwgardner/kaggle-ml-survey-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. I tried various ways to get the report to render correctly here on WordPress, but to no avail. If anyone has some CSS magic that could make the window below bigger (i.e. without the scrollbar) let me know!

This report got longer than I anticipated. There's quite a bit of rich data from the survey. I hope to do another report sometime soon that looks into more conditional insights.

Enjoy!

-Chad
